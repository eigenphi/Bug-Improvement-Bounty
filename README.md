# Improvement-Bounty

This is a continuation of the series of bounty programs created for both our certified and prospective members.  To show an appreciation for external and internal contributions, EigenPhi maintains a Bug and Improvement Bounty Program that is designed to reward responsible disclosure of qualifying bugs and improvements regarding our new tool “EigenTx”. 

EigenTx is a public-facing data visualization tool on various chains, which aims to help understand the details of any on-chain transactions, whether straightforward or complex.
